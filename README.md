# multiplicative chaos in number theory

This repository hosts code and data for the paper "A conjectural asymptotic formula for multiplicative chaos in number theory" by D. Aggarwal, U. Subedi, W. Verreault, A. Zaman, and C. Zheng. 

* [generate_A_N_for_standard_complex_Gaussian_samples.cpp](https://github.com/asif-z/multiplicative-chaos/blob/main/generate_A_N_for_standard_complex_Gaussian_samples.cpp) has C++ code for the case when (X_k) is a sequence of independent standard complex Gaussians.
* [generate_A_N_for_standard_real_Gaussian_samples.cpp](https://github.com/asif-z/multiplicative-chaos/blob/main/generate_A_N_for_standard_real_Gaussian_samples.cpp) has C++ code for the case when (X_k) is a sequence of independent standard real Gaussians.
* [generate_A_N_for_pm1_samples.cpp](https://github.com/asif-z/multiplicative-chaos/blob/main/generate_A_N_for_pm1_samples.cpp) has C++ code for the case when (X_k) is a sequence of independent random variables uniform on {\pm 1}.
* [compute_canada.md](https://github.com/asif-z/multiplicative-chaos/blob/main/compute_canada.md) has a brief introduction to using [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca) clusters, where the majority of our computations were performed.
